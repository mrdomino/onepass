# passgen

This is my CLI password generator. There are many like it, but this one is mine.
This is an _extremely_ rough cut, but it should suffice to demonstrate the idea:
take a master password, shmush it together with a site URI, and sample it to get
a random number bounded by the size of your password schemaâ€™s universe.

This lets you not need to use a password manager, only need to memorize a single
password, and yet use unique passwords for all of your sites.
