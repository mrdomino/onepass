# onepass

This is my CLI password generator. There are many like it, but this one is mine.

More specifically, this is a deterministic password manager: turn one master password into any number of unique, strong per-site passwords. No secrets stored, config can be public.

## Installation

### macOS (Recommended)
Download signed binaries from [GitHub releases](https://github.com/mrdomino/onepass/releases/latest).

### Cargo
```sh
cargo install onepass
```

### From Source
```sh
cargo build --release && install target/release/onepass ~/bin/onepass
```

A default config is generated at `${XDG_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.config}/onepass/config.yaml` on first run. See also the included [example config](example/config.yaml).

## Quick Start

```sh
onepass google.com
# Enter master password when prompted
# â†’ Generates deterministic password for https://google.com/
```

Use schemas to control password format:
```sh
onepass -s pin iphone.local    # 8-digit PIN
onepass -s phrase github.com   # 5-word passphrase
```

## Key Features

**URL Canonicalization**: `google.com` becomes `https://google.com/`â€Šâ€”â€Šsame master password always generates the same site password.

**Schema Support**: Regex-like patterns control password format:
- `[A-Za-z0-9]{18}`â€Šâ€”â€Š18 alphanumeric characters
- `[:word:](-[:word:]){4}`â€Šâ€”â€Š5 words separated by dashes
- `[!-~]{12}`â€Šâ€”â€Š12 printable ASCII characters (default)

**Password Rotation**: Increment parameter lets you rotate passwords without changing your master password.

**Usernames**: Allows you to use different passwords for different accounts on a site.

## How It Works

We use Argon2d to derive a 256-bit key from your master password with salt `{increment},{url}`. That key seeds a BLAKE3 extendable output function, which generates a uniform random number to select from all possible passwords matching your schema.

Same inputs â†’ same outputs. Always.
