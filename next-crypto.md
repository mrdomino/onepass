# Cryptosystem change ideas

This document collects ideas for breaking changes to the password generation scheme. these may make it into the next major version.

## Include the schema in the salt
By adding the schema to the salt explicitly, we guarantee that different password schemas will generate uncorrelated passwords from each other. That it doesnâ€™t work that way right now is a little unintuitive; users will expect that a change of schema will be a new password, and there is no reason to preserve the incidental correlation across different schemas.

This will require somehow having a way to distinguish the end of the schema, probably by escaping or encoding the schema (unless we can use a delimiter that will not ever appear in a URL.)
